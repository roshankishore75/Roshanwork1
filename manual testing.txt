Why testing required ?

to unearth and correct defects
to detect defects early ans to reduce cost of defect fixing
to ensure that product works as user expected it to
to avoid user detecting problem

What types of application we test

Desktop Applications
Web Applications
Enterprize Applications
Mobile Applications

what is SDLC and different phases in SDLC?
 
Software development life cycle is a process or methodology used to develop a software in a systematic Approach.

SDLC has 6 phases:
Requrement gathering
Analysis and planning
Software design
coding
testing
Release And Maintenance

Different types of SDLC models:

Sequential model
Iterative or incremental model

Sequential models:
waterfall model 
v model

Iterartive or incremental models:

prototyping model
Sprial model
Agile model

what is waterfall method

Water fall model is Sequential design process,used in software development process.

Roles :
business analyst or business team requirements gathering
technical manager or senior developers in Analysis and project manager in planning
System architect or tech lead design
Development leads and developers in coding
test leads,testers in testing phase
project manager,release team anda maintance team  in release and maintance phase


what is agile method
 Agile means moving quickely,when applied to software development, it means that delevering the software that meets customer requirements in shortest possible time.



Agile models:
Extreme programming
Scum model

what is scrum methodology
Scrum is an iterative and incermental Agile SD methodology for managing software development
 in this model ,system is divided into small parts know as Sprints.the duration of each sprint can range From  one week to three weeks.
at the end of the work,team members and stake holders meet to assess the progress of the project and identify further plan of action.
this assessment can be helps in taking stalk of the currents state and rework the line of work and complete the project on time and not just predict the further outcome


what is the process in agile model

Agile softwarelife cycle is an iterative process when software is ready at each iteration but can always be improved in next iteration

what is product back log items?
  
in scrum,a product backlog item is a unit of work small enough to be completed by a team in one sprint iteration.backlog items are decomposed into one or more tasks

what is user story/feature/sprint back log items and tasks in user story?

Sprint baclog contains just the things we'll work on during one sprint



what is sprint planing meeting
what is sprint review meeting
what is sprint retrospective 
what is sprint grooming
what is burndown chart and velocity
what is user acceptance criteria test cases

what is v model?

v model is also known as verification and validation model.in v model ,testing is done in parallel with corresponding development activity


what is STLC?
what is defect?
how to arise a defect and what we specify while logging defect?
defect lifecycle
What is unit testing?
when do we use regression testing?
What is integration testing?
when do we use integration testing?
when do we use smoke testing and sanity testing?
what is unit testing?
what is UAT?
